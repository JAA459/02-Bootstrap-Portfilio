# Bootstrap Portfolio Homework
In this work I was tasked with creating 3 seperate html files all mapped with bootstrap that perform together to create a website about myself, a starter portfolio with random pictures, and a page in which I can be contacted. All while using bootstrap, semantic html elements, along with organization.
